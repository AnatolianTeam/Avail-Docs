This distinction is subtle, as a Validium isn't strictly a \"layer 2\" in the traditional sense; it doesn't post data to L1, introducing different trust considerations. However, in many contexts, it's still categorized as a layer 2 solution. Fundamentally, a Validium can be described as a rollup combined with off-chain data availability, akin to Avail's approach."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.h2,{id:"validator",children:"Validator"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.p,{children:"An Avail validator is a full node that is responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.h2,{id:"volition",children:"Volition"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Volitions represent an advanced form of zero-knowledge rollups, offering developers the flexibility to decide the storage location for transaction data, be it on-chain or off-chain.
